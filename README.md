# CNN-ECA: Long-term Downscaling Model for Wind Speed

Welcome to the GitHub repository for CNN-ECA, a long-term downscaling model for wind speed.

## Introduction
CNN-ECA is a deep learning model designed to downscale wind speed data over a long-term period. It uses CNN based on an attention mechanism called Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) to capture important spatial and temporal features in wind speed patterns. By training on historical wind speed data and meteorological predictors, CNN-ECA can generate high-resolution wind speed predictions for a given location and time frame.

## Features
Long-term downscaling: CNN-ECA can generate wind speed predictions over extended time periods, making it suitable for studying long-term trends and patterns.\
High-resolution predictions: The model provides high-resolution wind speed predictions, allowing for detailed analysis and applications that require fine-grained data.\
Attention mechanism: CNN-ECA incorporates the Efficient Channel Attention mechanism to capture essential features in wind speed data, enabling improved predictive performance.
